<!DOCTYPE html> tag is used for specifying which language and version the document is using. This is referred to as Document Type Declaration (DTD)
<html> tag represents the root of an HTML Document. It tells the browser that this is an HTML Document. All other HTML Elements and tags (except the !DOCTYPE html tag) are nested between the <html> and </html> tags
<head> tag indicates the head section which is a container for all the head elements which must include a title for the document, and can include scripts, styles and meta information, etc.

Refer structure.html now where remaining tags are mentioned with information.
